To access the DiabetesAnalysis folder, a github repository was created which could be access through https://github.com/B0nitoFlakes/Diabetes_Analysis.
The Data Visualization Assignment 2.ipynb files are the original files that has all the codes, detailed explanations, and documentation in it.
The Dataset folder is where the Diabetes.csv file are saved.
the DVenv folder is for virtual environment to run the streamlit app.
The app.py file is the streamlit files that consist of all the codes required to run streamlit within a local host.
auc_scores.csv, accuracy_results.csv, and also confusion_matrix.jpg are files that are downloaded from the original ipynb file and displayed in the Predictions section due to the reason of the drastic accuracy changes when the codes were loaded into the app.py. Therefore, these files will display the original accuracy which is the best accuracy.
